                        <div class="text_left">The inspiration for this project was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.allrgb.com/">https://www.allrgb.com/</a> where there are many images with no two pixels the same
                            colour. There are many approaches demonstrated, but I wanted to see if I could achieve similar results with an evolutionary algorithm.</div>
                        <div class="text_left">My idea was simple, I'd select an image to try to replicate in every colour, create an output image containing one pixel of every colour, and an use a hill-climbing algorithm to adjust the output image
                            to be more similar to the input image. The basic premise for all three algorithms I wrote is that two pixels are selected at random, and they are swapped if the algorithm calculates that it would improve the image. Given
                            that there are 16,777,216 pixels in one of these images, it may take a billion or more swaps to reach a result that looks good.</div>

                    <h3>RGB Error</h3>
                    <div class="text">Each pixel is scored by how closely its individual colour channels match the target image. Each pixel has three 0-255 values representing how much of each colour it has in it, by subtracting the red value of the
                        target from the red value of the output pixel.</div>
                    <div class="text">This image contains glaring issues in the dark areas, and loses the shadows amongst the grass and on the roses. Also the fact that the target image contains more green than any other colour results in the reds
                        and blues being forced into unatural places.</div>

                    <h3>HSV Error</h3>
                    <div class="text">Similar to RGB error except the pixel is converted to the HSV colourspace first. This means that we can bias the error calculation to prefer pixels that are closer in brightness, which may be desirable because
                        human eyesight is much more adept at percieving brightness differences than it is colour differences.</div>
                    <div class="text">While this image does improve the dark regions, and does bring back the shadows in the grass and on the roses, the trade-off to sacrifice colour accuracy for brightness accuracy is very evident.</div>

                    <h3>Area Averaging</h3>
                    <div class="text">This uses the same algorithm as the RGB error except it compares the average colour of a small area around each pixel, rather than just each individual pixel. This does however slow down the algorithm
                        greatly.</div>
                    <div class="text">This is by far the most natural looking image, however it really sacrifices the contrast, making the colours all look washed out.</div>
